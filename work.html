      <h2><a href= uploads/github.pdf>Github Research</a></h2>
      <p> I conducted research on Github, a popular online repository for software development. I found that when users are told Github can be used for x amount of features, they think it is limited to this. They do not explore other things that it has to offer. On the contrary, when left to explore it themselves, they take more advantage of everything it has to offer.</p>

      <h2><a href= uploads/onlineretailer.pdf>Online Retailer Research</a></h2>
      <p> A thorough insight into online retailers. I discovered a UX truth: The more niched your user base, the simpler your requirements will be. The broader your user base, the more complex your requirements will be.</p>

      <h2><a href= uploads/interview.pdf>Perceptions of Public Transportation Research</a></h2>
      <p>I conducted research on the public transportation infrastrucutre throughout Ann Arbor. I found that public transit is seen as a necessity and technology won't impact its use but will affect a user's overall perception of the overall experience. These implications are powerful; technology has a direct imapct on user experience.</p>
